Project Overview
This WPF-based chatbot application serves as a Cybersecurity Awareness Assistant designed to help South African citizens learn about online safety. It simulates natural conversations, allows users to manage cybersecurity tasks, and includes an interactive quiz game.

This project demonstrates my knowledge of C# programming, XAML-based GUI design, natural language processing simulation, and real-world software design principles.

Features:

Chatbot Core
Recognizes keywords and user intent using basic NLP.
Responds to user input with educational cybersecurity advice.
Supports personalized responses using stored user data.

NLP & Sentiment Detection
Detects phrases like “remind me to” or “add a task to” using keyword analysis and regular expressions.
Responds with empathy based on detected moods (e.g., worried, frustrated, curious).

Task Assistant (GUI)
Users can create cybersecurity tasks (e.g., “Enable 2FA”) via chat.
Supports reminders with future dates.
Tasks can be marked as complete or deleted.
Dynamic task list displays titles, descriptions, and reminders.

Activity Log (GUI)
Stores and displays user actions (e.g., tasks added, quiz started).
Users can ask: show activity log or what have you done? to view recent actions.

Cybersecurity Quiz (Mini-Game)
Interactive quiz with 10+ questions on password safety, phishing, and more.
Multiple choice & true/false format.
Instant feedback and short explanation for each answer.
Final score summary is shown and stored.

Tech Stack
C# (Logic & Classes)
WPF & XAML (GUI)
.NET Framework
GitHub + GitHub Actions (CI)
